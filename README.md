MoltenChain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain for the native MAGMA cryptocurrency.

MoltenChain is a blockchain that has been specifically written for the MAGMA cryptocurrency network and its ecosystem.

MoltenChain has been completely written in TypeScript and features smart contract deployment written in Lua.
We have included a security feature to sanitize the Lua code deployed to the MoltenChain network.
